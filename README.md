# seated-

This program will be a way of organizing seating arrangemnts for any type/size of event. Seated will provide the user with a blank canvas or pre-existing template layout 
and will implement a "drag-and-drop" UI to create seating arrangements.

Additionally, Seated will also be designed to save information about a seating chart, save the layout of tables/seats as a template for the 
ability to reuse a layout, and will also allow the user to record custom information about the occupant of each seat. The custom information 
could be things like personality traits, age, gender, etc. to help the user know what people are sitting where. This type of tool could be
especially helpful for occupations like Teachers, where the information about the individual students is very important. Once custom information is added,
users can create rules pertaining to what types of people are sitting where. Using the teaching profession as an example, teachers could create a rule
which alerts them if they sit two pupils with a tag of "trouble-maker", or "talker" within a user-specified distance of one another.

Beyond the rule system, the program will provide "auto-seat" functionality, taking into account any rules created by the user, and automatically generating 
a seating chart based on them.

---This is a self-motivated project and is something I have been thinking of developing for a long time. Now that time is here and I am very exceited to continue 
planning and to begin the real development of this project.

---Future additions to this project will include porting the desktop version of this application to mobile OS
